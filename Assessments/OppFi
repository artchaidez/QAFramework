NOTE: TARGET_URL and API_KEY not added here, so if you are cloning or forking this repo, you will not be
able to run the OppFi Tests

Business requirements
Oppfi has many business partners who provide us with potential customers looking for a loan.
We have an endpoint that will decide whether to accept or decline potential customers. If the
endpoint accepts a potential customer, an offer is included in the response.
Some of the fields are required.

Your Mission
Using any language and any framework, you need to write automated tests that will call the
offers endpoint.
  1. The API_KEY and TARGET_URL can not be hardcoded and committed to the repo.
  They must be read as environment variables or using some other configurable option
  (like a command line argument).
  2. There should be a minimum of three tests.
    a. A test that gets an offer (accepted)
    b. A test where the customer is declined
    c. A test where the system doesn’t make a decision due to missing or malformed
    request data.
  3. The tests should assert that the data in the returned JSON payload in the response body
  is correct (especially the offers block).
  4. We need to see your code when done. So either give us a link to a Github repo or GIST,
  or zip them up and give them to your recruiter.
  5. We also need to be able to run the code - please include instructions for how to run your
  tests in a README or something. We might not be familiar with the framework you’re
  using.

Technical Documentation
We require 2 request headers in addition to the field parameters. “Content-Type:
application/json” specifies that this is a JSON request. The header “x-api-key: API_KEY”
contains your authentication token. The token is listed at the top of this document.

The endpoint must be called with POST.

Controlling accepted or denied leads:
Our Test environment accepts any test data; however, you can use two social security numbers
in particular for testing. Replace the following values in the sample request below.

Always Accepted 
SSN: 123456780
State: FL
Income: 100000

Always Declined SSN: 123450000

Sample Request
This sample request will result in an offer. Change the SSN to get a declined response. And
change the request fields to get an error (see Request JSON Field documentation below).
