Assignment:
Podium strives to help local businesses connect to their customers. We have an
important flow they use to receive messages from customers directly. We would like
you to build an automation test suite covering core user flows for our webchat widget
product, ensuring it works for users. In a plot twist, please do not test the happy path of
submitting a completed valid form, but instead test right up to before submitting an
official form.

Webchat widget to automate can be found here:
https://demo.podium.tools/qa-webchat-lorw/

*Note: There are only 4 locations available, no other locations will be populated based
on the search input.

We would like you to use one of the following frameworks/languages for this
assignment:
● Selenium + Java or Python
● Cypress + Javascript

We would also like to be able to run your suite locally, from the command line, and we
use Mac computers, so be sure to make your suite as OS-agnostic as possible. If any
configuration is needed before we can run it, ensure that it's covered clearly in the
documentation. Github repo is preferred, and documentation in the readme is fine.

Deliverables:
● An executable automated test suite, consisting of at least 5 test cases
● Readme file

Extra Credit:
● Dockerized test job for easy execution (include dockerfile)
● Test cases identified in prioritization, including smoke vs. regression
● Identify any bugs (if found)

The exercise should take no longer than 3-4 hours, but you have a week to complete. Let
us know if you have any questions, good luck!
